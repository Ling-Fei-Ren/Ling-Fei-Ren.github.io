I am currently an Assistant Professor at the [School of Computing and Artificial Intelligence, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics](https://it.swufe.edu.cn/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in 2024 from the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/) at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Prof. [Ruimin Hu]. I am also a member of [CCCI Group](https://ccci.swufe.edu.cn/) ([认知计算与群智协同创新团队](https://ccci.swufe.edu.cn/)), which is led by Prof. [Xin Yang](https://it.swufe.edu.cn/info/1119/2300.htm) ([杨新](https://it.swufe.edu.cn/info/1119/2300.htm)).

Research
======
The long-term research goal of our team is to develop robust and trustworthy machine learning methods for complex, high-dimensional, and distributed data environments. Most recently, our research focuses on **machine learning and its applications in data mining**. The following are some related research problems:

- **How to uncover and leverage graph data?**
  - Related Topics: Graph machine learning, graph anomaly detection, graph fraud detection, etc.

- **How to collaboratively train models across decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy?**
  - Related Topics: Federated Learning, Federated Graph Learning, etc.

- **How to enable models to learn from non-stationary data without catastrophic forgetting continually?**
  - Related Topics: Continual Learning, Lifelong Learning, Incremental Learning, etc.

Recruitment
======
**招收对图机器学习、联邦大小模型、金融风控、持续学习等人工智能和数据挖掘领域感兴趣，有较好编程基础的学生！**
